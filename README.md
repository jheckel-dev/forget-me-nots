# forget-me-nots
A simple note taker utilizing express to persistently store notes in a database.

## Summary
- using express we are able to create an application that persistently stores notes in a database that can be referred back to and eventual;ly deleted when no longer needed.
- in order to do this I attempted to use Localhost as the source for my API.

## Features
- an index.js file that acts as our front end and renters our index.html and notes.html pages
- a server.js file that runs our routes to local host
- a provided css document for visual appeal
- a DB file that stores a supplemental database
